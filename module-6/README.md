# Module 6: JavaScript for the Browser – Events, Forms & Timing

## Intro
"Now that you know the basics of JavaScript, it's time to see how it interacts with the browser. This module focuses on making websites interactive — we'll cover user events, form handling, and using timers to bring pages to life."

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Handle user events (clicks, input, etc.)
- Manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Validate and process form data
- Use timers and intervals for dynamic behavior
- Create interactive user interfaces

## Topics Covered

### 1. DOM Manipulation & Events (8 minutes)
- Selecting elements with `querySelector` and `getElementById`
- Adding event listeners (`click`, `input`, `submit`)
- Modifying element content and styles
- Creating and removing elements

### 2. Forms & User Input (7 minutes)
- Form validation techniques
- Preventing default form submission
- Real-time input feedback
- Local storage for persistence

## Projects

### Project 1: Interactive To-Do List
**Location**: `./project-1/`
**Time**: 8 minutes
**Concepts**: DOM manipulation, event handling, array methods, local storage

A fully functional to-do list where users can add, complete, and delete tasks with data persistence.

### Project 2: Form Validator
**Location**: `./project-2/`
**Time**: 7 minutes
**Concepts**: Form handling, validation, real-time feedback, regular expressions

A contact form with real-time validation that provides immediate feedback to users.

## Key Teaching Points
1. **Event-driven programming** - Show how user actions trigger code
2. **DOM as a live document** - Demonstrate how changes appear instantly
3. **User experience** - Focus on providing immediate feedback
4. **Data persistence** - Show how to save user data locally

## Interactive Demonstrations
- **Live coding**: Add event listeners and see immediate results
- **Break things intentionally**: Show common errors and how to debug
- **Student participation**: Have them suggest features to add

## Common Mistakes to Address
- Forgetting to prevent default form submission
- Not checking if elements exist before manipulating them
- Event listener memory leaks (adding multiple listeners)
- Not validating user input

## Browser Developer Tools
- Show how to inspect elements
- Demonstrate the console for debugging
- Use breakpoints to step through code
- Network tab for understanding requests

## Outro
"You've now made your pages react to user input and events — great progress! Next, we'll dive into real-time data and learn how to fetch content from APIs."
