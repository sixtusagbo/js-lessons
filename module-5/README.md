# Module 5: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Intro
"Welcome to JavaScript Fundamentals. In this module, we're diving into the programming language of the web. You'll learn variables, functions, data types, and control flow â€” the essential building blocks of JavaScript."

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Declare and use variables with different data types
- Write and call functions
- Use conditional statements and loops
- Understand basic JavaScript syntax and structure

## Topics Covered

### 1. Variables and Data Types (5 minutes)
- `let`, `const`, and `var`
- Numbers, strings, booleans
- Arrays and objects basics
- Template literals

### 2. Functions and Control Flow (10 minutes)
- Function declaration and expressions
- Parameters and return values
- If/else statements
- For and while loops

## Projects

### Project 1: Personal Info Calculator
**Location**: `./project-1/`
**Time**: 5 minutes
**Concepts**: Variables, data types, basic operations, template literals

A simple calculator that takes personal information and performs basic calculations like age calculation, BMI, etc.

### Project 2: Simple Game Logic
**Location**: `./project-2/`
**Time**: 5 minutes
**Concepts**: Functions, conditionals, loops, arrays

A number guessing game that demonstrates control flow and function usage.

## Key Teaching Points
1. **Start with console.log()** - Show immediate feedback
2. **Use meaningful variable names** - Good coding practices from the start
3. **Demonstrate debugging** - Show how to find and fix errors
4. **Interactive examples** - Let students modify values and see results

## Common Mistakes to Address
- Forgetting semicolons (though not required, good practice)
- Mixing up `=` (assignment) and `===` (comparison)
- Variable scope confusion
- Not understanding function return values

## Outro
"Nice work getting through JavaScript fundamentals! You've built a solid base with variables, functions, loops, and logic. But now it's time to bring those skills into the browser to make your pages interactive and user-friendly. In the next module, you'll start working with events, forms, and user actions to build truly dynamic websites."
